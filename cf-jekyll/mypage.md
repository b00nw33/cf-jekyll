layout: page
title: My page

# mypage.md
- I noticed that test.html is not showing up in the navbar, so I am testing if mypage.md would show up.
- ~~Doesn't seem to work~~ Works fine with .md extension!
- Conclusion: `layout` and `title` have to be specified in front matter in order to be recognised as a page.
- Link to [test.html](test.html)
