# cf-jekyll
I created this site following the [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-jekyll-site/) tutorial.
This is the first bootstrap installation which I managed to deploy on 3 platforms (Cloudflare, Vercel and GitHub Pages). I used ChatGPT to help tweak the default workflow file to work for a project in a subfolder.
